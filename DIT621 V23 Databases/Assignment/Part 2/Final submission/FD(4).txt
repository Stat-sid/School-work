______OPTION 1______:

D(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName, courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification, grade, position)
    
                                                            
login -> studentIdnr                                                                 
studentIdnr -> studentName, login, branchName, programName
courseCode -> courseName,capacity, credits, departmentName
studentIdnr, courseCode -> grade
studentIdnr, courseCode -> position
position, coursecode -> studentIdnr                         
                                                               
               
The FD login -> studentIdnr violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table is split into the two below:

D_2(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName)
D_3(login, courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification, grade, position)


D_2 is in BCNF!
D_3 is not in BCNF!


The FD courseCode,login --> position violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table is split into the two below:

D_3_1(courseCode, credits, coursename, departmentName, capacity, grade, position)
D_3_2(login, courseCode, classification)


D_3_1 is not in BCNF!
D_3_2 is in BCNF!


The FD courseCode --> courseName,credits,departmentName,capacity violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table is split into the two below:

D_3_1_1(courseCode,courseName,credits,departmentName,capacity)
D_3_1_2(courseCode,login,position,grade)



Final schema:

D_2(login,studentIdnr,studentName,branchName,programName)
D_3_2(login, courseCode, classification)
D_3_1_1(courseCode,courseName,credits,departmentName,capacity)
D_3_1_2(courseCode,login,position,grade) 



MVDs:                                -
studentIdnr ->> courseCode  
courseCode ->> classification

D_3_2 is not in 4NF

D_3_2_1(courseCode, classification)
D_3_2_2(login, coursecode)                   


                                                                          
so in 4NF:
D_2(login,studentIdnr,studentName,branchName,programName)
D_3_2_1(courseCode, classification)
D_3_2_2(login, coursecode) 
D_3_1_1(courseCode,courseName,credits,departmentName,capacity)
D_3_1_2(courseCode,login,position,grade)

position, coursecode -> studentIdnr                         
                                                               
               
The FD login -> studentIdnr violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table is split into the two below:

D_2(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName)
D_3(login, courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification, grade, position)


D_2 is in BCNF!
D_3 is not in BCNF!


The FD courseCode -> credits, coursename, departmentName, capacity violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table is split into the two below:

D_3_1(courseCode, credits, coursename, departmentName, capacity, classification)
D_3_2(login,courseName, courseCode, grade, position)


D_3_1 is in BCNF!
D_3_2 is in BCNF!


Final schema:

D_2(login,studentIdnr,studentName,branchName,programName)
D_3_1(courseCode,courseName,credits,departmentName,capacity,classification)
D_3_2(login,courseCode,grade,position)


MVDs:                                -
studentIdnr ->> courseCode  
courseCode ->> classification

D_3_1 is not in 4NF

D_3_1_1(courseCode, classification)
D_3_1_2(courseName,credits,departmentName,capacity)                   


                                                                          
so in 4NF:
