D(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName, courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification, grade, position)

studentIdnr -> studentName, login, branchName, programName
login -> studentIdnr
courseCode -> courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification
studentIdnr, courseCode -> grade, position


The FD studentIdnr -> studentName, login, branchName, programName violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table is split into the two below:

D_2(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName)
D_3(studentIdnr, courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification, grade, position)

D_2 is in BCNF!

The FD courseCode -> courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table is split into the two below:

D_3_1(courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification)
D_3_2(studentIdnr, courseCode, grade, position)

D_3_1 is in BCNF!
D_3_2 is in BCNF!

Final schema:
D_2(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName)
D_3_1(courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification)
D_3_2(studentIdnr, courseCode, grade, position)


MVDs:
courseCode ->> classification
programName ->> departmentName
branchName ->> programName

D_3_1 also contains a MVD, hence is broken down to:

D311(courseCode, classification)
D312(courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity)

D_2 also contains a MVD, hence is broken down to:

D_2_1(branchName, programName)
D_2_2(studentIdnr, studentName, login, programName)
