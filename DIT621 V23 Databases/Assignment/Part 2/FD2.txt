courseCode ->  credits, departmentName, capacity
studentIdnr, courseCode -> grade

The FD studentIdnr -> studentName, login, branchName, programName violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table is split into the two below:

D_2(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName)
D_3(studentIdnr, courseCode, courseName, credits, departmentName, capacity, classification, grade, position)


D_2 is in BCNF!


The FD courseCode -> credits, departmentName, capacity violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table is split into the two below:

D_3_1(courseCode, credits, departmentName, capacity)
D_3_2(studentIdnr,courseName, courseCode, grade, position, classification)


D_3_1 is in BCNF!
D_3_2 is not in BCNF!


The FD studentIdnr, courseCode -> grade violates BCNF as the LHS is not superkey. Table D_3_2 is split into the two below:

D_3_2_1(studentIdnr, courseCode, grade, position)
D_3_2_2(studentIdnr, courseCode, courseName, classification)


D_3_2_1 is in BCNF!
D_3_2_2 is in BCNF!


Final schema:
D_2(studentIdnr, studentName, login, branchName, programName)
D_3_1(courseCode, credits, departmentName, capacity)
D_3_2_1(studentIdnr, courseCode, grade, position)
D_3_2_2(studentIdnr, courseCode, courseName, classification)


MVDs:                                -
studentIdnr ->> courseCode  
courseCode ->> classification

D_3_2_2 is not in 4NF

D_3_2_2_1(courseCode, classification)
D_3_2_2_2(studentIdnr,coursename)                   


D_3_2_1 is not in 4NF

D_3_2_1_1(studentIdnr,courseCode,position)  
D_3_2_1_2(studentIdnr, courseCode, grade)    

                                                                          
so in 4NF:
D_2_1(login,studentIdnr)
D_2_2(studentIdnr, studentName, branchName, programName)
D_3_1(courseCode, credits, departmentName, capacity)
D_3_2_2_1(courseCode, classification)
D_3_2_2_2(studentIdnr,coursename)  
D_3_2_1_1(studentIdnr,courseCode,position)  
D_3_2_1_2(studentIdnr,courseCode,grade)
